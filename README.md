# Levene VR TPR Simulations
Researchers frequently underestimate the sample sizes needed to reliably detect typical group differences in variability and tail behavior. Three simulation studies are implemented here to emphasize and delineate this issue.

### Terms and acronyms

Levene's test - A test of homogeneity of variance, the median-based variant of which is highly robust (and also known as the Brown-Forsythe test).

Variance Ratio (VR) - The ratio of variance in one group to variance in another group. Its square root is the standard deviation ratio.

Tail Proportion Ratio (TPR) - A relational measure of density in a specified range which compares the proportions of two distributions above or below a given cut-point in the form of a ratio. The range is defined by the combined distribution (e.g., the cut-point is the 90th percentile and the tail's range is all data above the 90th percentile).

Real VR / Real TPR - The expected value of an observed VR/TPR when sampling from a given pair of distributions.

Directional Error Rate (DER) - A ratio of 1 indicates equality. Real VRs/TPRs in these simulations are always greater than 1, so observed VRs/TPRs less than 1 are qualitatively incorrect. The DER is the percentage of observed VRs/TPRs less than 1.

Tail Size (TS) - The number of data points beyond a given cut-point (CP). Cut-points in the TPR simulation specify the top or bottom 1% or 10%. For instance, the tail size beyond a 10% cut-point in a sample of 300 is 30.

## VR Simulation
Take the example of real VR = 1.1 and n = 500. This simulation generates 250 data points from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, and another 250 from a distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.1. It then computes and records the observed VR. This is performed ten million times, and the result was DER = 22.63%. That is, 22.63% of observed VRs fell below 1, compared to a random baseline of 50%.

Real VRs range from 1.1 to 1.4 and sample sizes from 20 to 3,000. Higher real VRs and larger samples produce fewer observed VRs below 1.

All results are plotted in the file 'VR Figure'.

## TPR Simulation
There are two variants of this simulation. Take an example of the simple variant: real TPR = 1.2, CP = 1%, TS = 100. First, the total group size is calculated: since the cut-point is 1%, the total group must be 100 times as large as the tail: 100 * 100 = 10,000. A formula then computes the standard deviation ratio (s) needed to produce an expected TPR of 1.2 in the top and bottom 1% of the combined distribution (with no mean difference, the tails are symmetric). About half of the 10,000 data points are generated from a normal distribution with mean 0 and sd 1, and the remainder from a distribution with mean 0 and sd sâ‰ˆ1.0298 (computed above). The quantile function locates the 1st percentile of the combined distribution of observed data, and the TPR below that point is computed and recorded. This is performed ten million times, and the result was DER = 17.98%.

The simple variant uses real TPRs of 1.1, 1.2, and 1.5; cut-points of 1% and 10%; and tail sizes between 10 and 1,000. The complex variant includes mean differences, expressed in terms of Cohen's d, and it experiments with higher real TPRs of 2 and 3. It has a more complicated formula for the standard deviation ratio. Higher real TPRs and larger tail sizes produce fewer observed TPRs below 1.

Results from the simple variant are plotted in the file 'TPR Figure'.

See the PDF file for an explanation of the formulas for the standard deviation ratio.

## Levene Simulation
Take the example of real VR = 1.3 and n = 1,000. This simulation generates 500 data points from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1, and another 500 from a distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.3. It then uses the 'car' package to conduct the median-based Levene's test, and the p value is recorded. This is performed ten million times, and the percentage of cases in which the variance difference is significant at the 5% level defines the power. The result was power = 77.94%.

This simulation computes the power to detect a variance difference with real VRs ranging from 1.1 to 1.4 and sample sizes from 20 to 15,000. Higher real VRs and larger samples produce greater power.

Results from sample sizes up to 1,000 are plotted in the file 'Levene 1000 Figure'.
